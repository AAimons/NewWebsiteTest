## That unexpected week in NY

A volte nella vita succedono cose inaspettate, cose fuori dall'ordinario e fuori dal controllo. Cose che non ci si sa spiegare e che ti fanno vivere espereinze magnifiche che si cristallizzeranno in ricordi indelebili. 
Ma in questo caso, c'è un artefice dietro a tutto ciò, una persona a me molto cara che si è fatto deus-ex-machina di questa mia settimana a New York e al quale sarò sempre riconoscente...

Viaggiare dall'altra parte del mondo per ritrovare facce amiche e aggiornarsi su come stanno andando le cose, se ci sia soddisfazione su un progetto appena portato a termine o ascoltare un nuovo visionario progetto in fase embrionale, è per me estremamente coinvolgente, linfa vitale e fonte di ispirazione, cibo per la mente. 


Ogni giorno che la giornata di exhibith si conclude nel tardo pomriggio, non finiscono però le interazioni con vecchie o nuove persone e  queste conversazioni è naturale che proseguono per le strade di New York che ti portano oggi in un basemant di soho domani in una villa a brooklyn per gli immancabili parti esclusivi che completano il quadro dell'evento. È una dimensione quella del festival che è molto vicina alla magia, o almeno, questo  è quello che mi dicono i ricordi di un più giovane Aimone in viaggio per il mondo.

È innegabile che a fianco di questi dialoghi ricolmi di passione per i media immersivi la consapevolezza di essere parte di un movimento pionieristico, ci sia anche una grande componente di opportunismo e politica volta a portare finanziamenti al proprio prossimo progetto...e in molti casi è una questione di simpatie e conoscenza. Ma va bene così, fa parte del gioco..."That's the life, baby. The life! And there's nothing you can do about it. Nothing!" per reintepretare una famosa citazione di ["Deadline - U.S.A" (1952)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044533/?ref_=ttqu_ov_i)

## Tribeca Immersive 2019

_**This is what I wrote at the time to share my experience with others.**_


By its very nature, the Tribeca Film Festival symbolizes rebirth and a forward-looking perspective. It's no surprise, then, that the future often discussed—characterized by virtual and augmented reality—is already unfolding at Spring Studios on Varick Street.

Now in its fifth consecutive year, the festival's "Tribeca Immersive" section aims to highlight projects produced in the past year that explore new forms of communication through immersive technologies.

Each project takes a different approach to technology, focusing on specific themes from social issues to entertainment, journalism, and pure visual experimentation.

These experiences are the collaborative efforts of artists, filmmakers, theatre directors, game designers, journalists, podcasters, and others—whom, for lack of a better term, we can call "creators."

Curated by Loren Hammonds, the selection shows that we're still in a period of total experimentation and blending of media. It's a time where anyone with a story to tell finds fertile ground for innovation, succeeding in narratives never before explored.

Entering the immersive section, visitors encounter 33 experiences divided into two subsections: "Cinema 360" and "Virtual Arcade." The former allows seated viewing with a 360° perspective using "three-degrees-of-freedom" (3DoF), while the latter enables visitors to move and interact within virtual space using headsets with "six-degrees-of-freedom" (6DoF).

Experiences in the "Virtual Arcade" are set in custom-designed settings that immediately convey specific atmospheres to visitors (similarly to what we realized on a smaller scale at [MFF 18](MFF)). This choice, while limiting distribution outside of festival, museum, or theme park contexts, grants creators the freedom to enhance viewer immersion.

One standout installation, resembling a giant luminous jellyfish, hosts "Drop in the Ocean"—an experience for four people simultaneously, aiming to emotionally engage visitors with urgent issues like ocean pollution. Afterward, visitors can actively contribute to related campaigns.

Two other notable experiences, "Wolves in the Walls" and "Bonfire," allow close, physical, and emotional interaction with main characters. This deep engagement is facilitated by rudimentary intelligence imbued by their creators, enabling active participation and responsive interactions akin to human relationships.

"Ayahuasca," an infusion from Amazonian plants known for its psychedelic effects, aims to simulate through immersive media the sensations and perceptions of those who have undergone this transcendental experience. Unlike traditional virtual reality, which avoids inducing "motion sickness" (conflict between visual perception and vestibular system), "Ayahuasca" cleverly uses hypnotic sounds and images to enhance realism.

Several projects blend "Immersive Theatre," popular in Anglo-Saxon culture, with Virtual Reality, yielding unexpected results. For instance, "The Collider" poses the question: what would you do if you controlled another person? This experience invites two participants into the same space—one visually impaired by headphones, the other controlling their actions via earpiece instructions.

Immersive realities also offer unfiltered storytelling on urgent issues, spanning journalism to social commentary. "Cinema 360" includes projects like "Accused No.2 Walter Sisulu," "Girl Icon," "Mercy," "12 Seconds of Gunfire," and "Children Do Not Play War," all aiming to raise awareness.

In the "Virtual Arcade," "Common Grounds" uses immersive techniques to highlight the struggles of residents in Aylesbury's public housing estates. Political, social, and human dynamics are universal themes found in both Italian and global contexts.

Most selected projects are international co-productions, with public and private entities contributing to funding and shared success. Italy is also fostering projects experimenting with immersive technologies, such as through the Venice Biennale's "College Cinema - Virtual Reality" grant, supporting creators in showcasing innovative works.

As we await a self-sustaining market, pro-bono support remains crucial for creators to explore new frontiers and enrich expressive media. This year's Tribeca Film Festival immersive section has not only met but exceeded expectations, serving as a key indicator of growth in this dynamic field.
## More memories in random order


- The proverb "Never meet your heores" became crystal clear to me after this experience.
- Spending 100$ to watch Coppola's masterpiece "Apocalypse Now" at the Apollo Theatre...with Coppola and Soderbergh in conversation right after the screening. The most fun part was Coppola's exceptional marketing ability of selling us such screening as a "Premiere" since none ever seen this version of the movie with this specific audio system. The movie is 40 years old but sold as a premiere, chapeau Francis!
- Coney Island.
- I tried the Magic Leap for the first time.
- A multi-user immersive theatre piece experienced with a quite famous Guggheneim curator...followed by a coffee.
- Jaron Lainer talk.
- I believe I spotted an Emmy Award just lying around on a table during a party.
