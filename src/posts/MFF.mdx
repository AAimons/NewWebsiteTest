## Honouring the new language

The Milan Film Festival was one of the most joyful experiences and rewarding work I have ever had.

It was a golden opportunity to engage the general public with those immersive experiences that I believed were best suited to better understand this new medium, often disparaged, dismissed, and underestimated. It was a chance to do justice to this new form of communication and to infect the participants with my same enthusiasm and passion.



I am still grateful today for the trust that the MFF president placed in me at just 24 years old; it was an honor to be entrusted with the leadership and responsibility of conceptualizing and realizing the immersive section of the MFF, taking care of every aspect.
From the selection of the experiences to their fruition through themed scenography.
From the press conference to the relationships with sponsors and partners.
From the ticketing system and managing the flow of people (the famous bottleneck resulting from the limited number of headsets and space) to creating marketing content to tell the story of the event.

The most pleasant and memorable moments were undoubtedly the exchanges I had with the participants of the section, to listen to their feelings and get insights for improvement. Many surprised faces, laughter, and a few tears of emotion.

With all the work and commitment we put into it, I also wanted to find a way to quantify and evaluate our performance in a pseudo-scientific manner, and so I prepared a questionnaire to give to the participants after their visit. It was a way to evaluate ourselves but also because I wanted to have data to present to potential sponsors the following year for another edition.
